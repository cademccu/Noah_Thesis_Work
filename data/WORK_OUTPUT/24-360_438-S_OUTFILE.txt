    ---NO_FRAGMENTS_ANY

B438:  Uh I don't think so uh because uh some equivalent uh equipment of our company is very expensive and uh our products is not selling well this is a very big problem uh in our company I think uh we have to uh uh uh monitor our uh company
    ---NO_FRAGMENTS_ANY

A360:  Oh yeah uh maybe I think we can we can have uh try with your opinion uh in uh but uh uh we we we don't uh don't need to uh put uh put monitor everywhere it just uh have some uh some evaluation in some place. Do you agree?
